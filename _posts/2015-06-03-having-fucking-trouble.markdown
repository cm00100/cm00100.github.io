Hello!! So I've been building this shit and I didn't think it was going to be easy as I thought.

For now I thought of just doing something simple enough and then grow from there.
The only problem I'm having so far is the main.css, it keeps fucking changing back to its default settings.
I think I quite know why.... I think since it came from jekyll directly... the css keeps going back to its default.
I need to figure out where to remove those settings in the folders.
Google is not working right now, so I have to use Yahoo... ugh!
