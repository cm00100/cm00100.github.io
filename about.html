            <p><h4>About Me</h4></p>
           My name is Cynthia Martinez. I am from Monterey County, California. I am currently a junior at California State University, Monterey Bay. My major is Computer Science
           with a concentration in Software Engineering. I transferred from Hartnell Community College
           where I graduated with my associates in Digital Arts. I come from a strong design background (graphic design, multimedia, videography, etc.). My current
           interests are Software Development, Robotics, Web Design, and Mathematics.
           My passion is among computing and design. I feel like my left and right brain are well balanced togther.
           My strongest skill is probably my creativity. I love to create things whether it is technical or art.
